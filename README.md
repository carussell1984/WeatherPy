# WeatherPy

#Objective is to use Python requests, APIs, and JSON to answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

#While our hypothesis is: "Yes, the weather is warmer as we approach the equator."  But, Can I prove it if needed?

#In this example, a Python script was created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the
#equator. To accomplish this, I utilizing a simple Python library, the [OpenWeatherMap API]#(https://openweathermap.org/api),
#to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

#The objective for this project is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
  # Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 
  # Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  # Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 
  # Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
